a) false, variables can be declared inside functions with the "static" or
"extern" storage class which have static storage duration

b) false, variables can be declared inside functions with the "extern" storage
class which has external linkage

c) true, linkage is determined by the storage class and there are four options:
- auto: no linkage
- static: internal linkage at file scope, no linkage at block scope
- extern: external linkage
- register: no linkage

Therefore, if a variable has internal linkage then it must be a static variable
at file scope so the statement is correct.

d) true, by default function parameters use the "auto" storage class and can
optionally be declared with the "register" storage class. In either case, the
parameter has block scope.
