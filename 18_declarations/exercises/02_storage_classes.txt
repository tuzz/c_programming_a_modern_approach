a) extern
b) static
c) extern, static

For c), consider each storage class:

- auto: this cannot affect the storage duration of a variable because it is
  illegal at file scope and it is the default for variables in functions.

- extern: this affects the storage duration of variables declared in functions
  which are auto by default. The storage duration becomes static with external
  linkage. At file scope, variables default to static storage duration, anyway.

- static: this affects the storage duration of variables declared in functions
  which are auto by default. The storage duration becomes static with internal
  linkage. At file scope, variables default to static storage duration, anyway.

- register: this cannot affect the storage duration of a variable because it is
  illegal at file scope and the storage duration of register is the same as
  the default storage duration (auto) which is automatic.
