a) false, the type qualifier "const" makes the variable read-only (immutable)
but its value may not be determined until runtime. The variable isn't constant
in the sense that the compiler knows its value at compile time and this is a
requirement in order to generated the assembly for switch statements, e.g.

void foo(int x, int y) {
  const int z = y / 2;

  switch (x) {
    case z: ... // illegal because z is computed at runtime
  }
}

b) true
c) true
d) true
