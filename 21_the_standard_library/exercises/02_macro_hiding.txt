The stdio.h header contains some macros that hide a functions. It includes
the _stdio.h file which contains these function declarations/prototypes:

int getc_unlocked(FILE *);
int putc_unlocked(int, FILE *);

And it also declares macros with the same names and arguments:

#define getc_unlocked(fp) __sgetc(fp)
#define putc_unlocked(x, fp) __sputc(x, fp)

The only purpose of these macros is to forward their arguments to the underlying
function call. For example, they do not pass other implicit arguments like stdin
or modify anything. Therefore, they are examples of a macro hiding a function.
