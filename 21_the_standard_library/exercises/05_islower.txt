This islower macro would not be legal according to the C standard:

#define islower (c) ((c) >= 'a' && (c) <= 'z')

For a macro to be legal in the C standard, all parameters must be protected by
parentheses and it must evaluate its arguments exactly once. In this case, the
first criterion is met but the second isn't because 'c' appears multiple times
in the macro definition. For exmaple, if we had the following code:

islower(c++);

The macro would expand to ((c++) >= 'a' && (c++) <= 'z') which would
unexpectedly increment the c variable twice.
