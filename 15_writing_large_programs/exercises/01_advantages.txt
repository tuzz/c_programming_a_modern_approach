a) Other advantages of dividing a large program into multiple source files

- The program can be maintained more easily by different people. For example, if
separate people first agree on a shared interface, they can work on their
domains independently without worrying about file conflicts.

- It's easier to understand the scope of changes in a revision control system
purely based on inspecting which files were changed in a commit.

- It's easier to analyse dependencies between parts of the code, e.g. to
understand which groups of functions are most heavily depended on. This might
inform decisions about where to spend time refactoring or adding features.

b) Some disadvantages of dividing a large program into multiple source files

- "Dependency hell" which is when the dependency tree becomes very complex and
it's hard to understand which files need to be compiled and linked in order to
build a target program.

- If a file was split into two but it actually shares a lot of functionality, it
can add extra maintenance overhead. Perhaps it would make sense to keep all the
code in one place rather than artificially splitting it across files.

- It adds additional design overhead of deciding what should go in the header
files and can add unnecessary indirection between code units.
