a) Function prototypes should be included in header files provided they are for
functions that are intended to be called by other parts of the program.

b) Function definitions should NOT be included in header files since that would
cause the program to recompile the definitions each time they are included into
a source file. Furthermore, the function definitions might not be available.

c) Macro definitions should be included in header files so they can be reused.

d) Type definitions should NOT be included in header files because storage will
be reserved at file scope. Instead, type _declarations_ should be included.
