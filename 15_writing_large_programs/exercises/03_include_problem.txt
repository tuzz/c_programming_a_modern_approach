Yes, there could be a problem when writing #include "file" instead of  <file>.
Although the compiler will first search the local directory and then check the
system headers to find the file, if (for some strange reason) there is a local
file that matches the name of a system header, it would be included instead of
the system header, which might not be what the user was expecting.
